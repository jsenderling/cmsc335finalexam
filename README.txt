App Description:
This app allows any user to sign up for membership to the fitness app, so that they can use a few different fitness calculators that rely
on the user's inputted data (e.g., height, weight, etc). Once someone signs up, all they need to do is provide name and email to do
the following operations: search for member data, end their membership, calculate BMI, calculate daily calorie intake, and calculate
ideal weight. All member data is stored in a MongoDB collection.

Notes:
- use node fitnessAppServer.js PORT_NUMBER_HERE to start server OR
- render URL: https://cmsc335finalexam-jsenderling.onrender.com
- app assumes name and email uniquely identify a member
- the Fitness Calculator API from rapidapi.com only supports the inputs of male or female for calculations that involve gender
